# RoboBACKUP-v1
(Automated Robocopy Backup GUI)
© 2023 by K.Bussard


RoboBACKUP v1.1
This is a basic program that will allow you to select multiple sources and a destination folder.
When you click RUN BACKUP, it will execute a set robocopy function that will perform a 
Full Backup + Differential Backups afterwards, if ran on the same Source / Destination folders.
There is no log file in this version, and there's no customizing the functions. Plain, Simple, Functional.


RoboBACKUP v1.5
This takes v1.1 to a more customizable version, with a few visual updates. It allows the end user to select from a few pre-defined
robocopy functions. It defaults to the predefined functions from v1.1 but allows the user to select other options. This version also allows 
the user to create a log of the backup. It will create a separate log file for each Source folder. This log will be located at the 
Destination Folder. There is also a visual printout of the complete robocopy function
located at the bottom of the window. A little bit more advanced, but still user friendly and simple to use.
